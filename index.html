        back to the area I regard as home, to meet my brothers and sisters and

      <span>Who Was Nelson Mandela?</span><br>Nelson Mandela was a social
      rights activist, politician and philanthropist who became South Africaâ€™s
      first Black president from 1994 to 1999. After becoming involved in the
      anti-apartheid movement in his 20s, Mandela joined the African National
      Congress in 1942. For 20 years, he directed a campaign of peaceful,
      nonviolent defiance against the South African government and its racist
      policies. Beginning in 1962, Mandela spent 27 years in prison for
      political offenses. In 1993, Mandela and South African President F.W. de
      Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to
      dismantle the country's apartheid system. For generations to come,
      Mandela will be a source of inspiration for civil rights activists
      worldwide.
